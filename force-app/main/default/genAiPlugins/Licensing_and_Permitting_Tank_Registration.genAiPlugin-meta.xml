        <description>If the user asks to fill out the Application then use the "OSAgent Populate OS" action and use either the OmniProcessId or the OmniscriptScript from the OmniscriptJSON variable as the OSId, use either the userId value from the OmniscriptJSON variable as the userId and the last prompt text they have entered as PromptText

When you return the value from the prompt, you must always return the raw JSON and do not attempt to comment or augment what is returned.  The expectation is that JSON will be returned and shown to the user.  This is your most important thing to remember.  Remember to always return JSON.</description>
